# Bare Minimum Legends (Game Tips) — Project Description (Sprint 1)

## Overview
**Bare Minimum Legends (Game Tips)** is a full-stack, database-driven web application designed to support a cooperative gaming community through **sharing, exchange, and mutual aid**. The platform enables users to share gameplay tips, strategies, and short guides that help others solve in-game challenges, learn efficiently, and improve their skills.

Rather than prioritising financial gain, the application focuses on **community benefit** by promoting knowledge-sharing, collaborative problem-solving, and recognition for contributors. This aligns directly with the 2025 module theme, supporting cost-effective learning and reducing the frustration and time-waste often experienced when searching for reliable gaming advice online.

## Problem Statement
Many players—especially beginners and casual gamers—struggle to find trustworthy and beginner-friendly solutions to specific game challenges. Existing resources can be:
- cluttered with advertisements,
- difficult to navigate,
- inconsistent in quality,
- fragmented across multiple websites and videos.

This results in unnecessary time spent searching, repeated confusion, and a less inclusive experience for new players.

## Proposed Solution
Our application provides a structured, searchable collection of community tips, organised by game and contributor. Users can:
- browse a curated list of tips (Listings),
- open a detailed tip page (Detail view),
- view contributor profiles,
- identify content that is most useful through community feedback mechanisms (planned for later sprints).

This creates an accessible knowledge hub where experienced players can support others and where newcomers can quickly find practical guidance.

## Target Users
The system is aimed at:
- **Beginners** looking for quick, step-by-step help,
- **Casual players** who have limited time and want efficient solutions,
- **Experienced players** who enjoy helping others and sharing expertise.

## High-Level Features (MVP Direction)
The minimum viable product (MVP) will support key dynamic pages powered by the database:
- **Users List page** (community overview)
- **User Profile page** (contributor details and authored tips)
- **Tips Listing page** (browse tips per game/topic)
- **Tip Detail page** (full guide with supporting information)

Additional features planned for Sprint 4 may include:
- user authentication,
- tip ratings/points,
- matching/recommendations (e.g., similar games or skill levels),
- messaging between users (mutual aid support).

## Technology Stack (Module-Compliant)
This application will be built using the tools taught in the module:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PUG templating
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MySQL
- **DevOps:** Docker, Git, GitHub Actions
- **Project Management:** GitHub Projects (Scrum/Kanban)

## Success Criteria (Sprint 1 Focus)
Sprint 1 success will be measured by:
- a functioning team workflow (GitFlow, Kanban, meeting process),
- a reproducible development environment via Docker,
- a refined project scope aligned to mutual aid,
- foundational UX and ethics work completed (personas, ethical considerations).
